• Objective: The primary aim of this project is to utilize the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the 
creation of detailed notes from YouTube lectures.
• Process: Input the URL of the YouTube video containing the lecture or content you wish to transcribe into the 
system. Click on the "Get Detailed Notes" button to initiate the transcription process. Watch in amazement as the 
AI-powered Gemini Pro model generates detailed notes based on the video transcript.
• Coding: The project employs Python code that utilizes the YouTube Transcription API for extracting video 
transcripts. The user interface is built using Streamlit. The core functionality of generating notes is powered by 
the Gemini Pro model, a powerful AI model trained.

 Skills Learnt: Programming Skills, API Integration, Generative AI, Python Libraries, Problem-Solving.
